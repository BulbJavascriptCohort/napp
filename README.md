## Napp

News-feed web app is for everybody that want to get access to up-to-date news on the go . I have come to realize that so many people do not pay attention to news or they don't have access to TV most times, this web app will be available to them anytime. The news-feed web application will help solve the emerging cases of fake new because all the news from this web will be verified news.
